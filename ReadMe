Homework Assignment: Final Project

Description: This is a burning paper simulation using particle systems. I have implemented heat equation for the same. This shows a transition of the particle (which is a part of the burning paper) from when it catches fire, represented by an orange particle to when it falls off the paper, represented by a grey particle which then turns black and disappears.
    You can control the camera motion using a mouse.
